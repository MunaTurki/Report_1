I have written a sample report powered by data in the context of the application for DW data jounalism position here: https://report-1-mauve.vercel.app/

Little notes about this report:

The source files generating the website, the plots and some sources referenced by the hyperlinks can be found on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/MunaTurki/Report_1

The file (Data_Analysis) contain the data files and the code with which the raw plots were generated. The code is written on a Notebook which generate the full report in an interactive HTML file. (Tried to upload it to the job portal but failed)

The file (Reports cited) contains some of the referenced pdfs. When relevant the cited information is highlighted for quick access.

 Happy reading! :)
